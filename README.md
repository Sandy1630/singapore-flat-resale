## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting flat resale prices based on features such as Sqft,flat type,flat model,and more. The model is trained on historical flat resale data to make predictions on new flat resale prices.

## Features

- Python based solution using popular libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost.
- Data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
- Machine learning model selection (Random Forest) and evaluation using (R2 score).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sandy1630/singapore-flat-resale.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Follow the steps outlined in the `flight_ticket_prediction.ipynb` notebook or run the scripts to perform data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
